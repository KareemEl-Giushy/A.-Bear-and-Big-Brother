#  A.-Bear-and-Big-Brother

Simply, we need to count how many would pass till **Limak** passes the wieght of his brother **Bob**

## Installation

```bash
php taskend.php
```
##### - Or you could run it in the browser
in the project's folder run this command :-
```bash
php -S localhost:port
```

## How it works ?

It's checking in a while loop if the **Limak's wieght** ($a) is smaller or equal to** Bob's wieght** ($b) if the condition is true** Limak's wieght** is tripled and **Bob's **is doubled, Until **Limak's wieght** passes** Bob's**. Then the loop will stop. Here that counter represents the years it took **Limak** to pass his brother.

## Variables
>* $a => Limak's Wieght
>* $b => Bob's Wieght
>*  $counter => Years

## Testing
I made a simple testing script that calls the function limak() and try some testing casses in it from the array tests.

* ###TRY THE TEST :-

```bash
php task1.php
```
##### - Or you could run it in the browser
in the project's folder run this command :-
```bash
php -S localhost:port
```
